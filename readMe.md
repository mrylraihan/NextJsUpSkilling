### Framework

A framework is a structured, pre-built platform or set of tools that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It offers a collection of libraries, functions, and reusable components that simplify and streamline the development process. Frameworks are designed to handle common tasks and functionalities, allowing developers to focus more on implementing specific features and logic unique to their applications. They abstract complex details, promote code reusability, enforce consistency, and speed up development by offering ready-made solutions for common tasks. 

In the world of web development, we encounter distinct frameworks, each serving specific rolesâ€”some dedicated to front-end tasks, while others specialize in backend operations. 

### Library 

A library is a collection of pre-written code or software components that developers can use to perform specific tasks or functions. Unlike a framework, a library does not provide a complete structure or foundation for an application. Instead, it offers individual functions, classes, or modules that can be integrated into an application to extend its capabilities.

When using a library, developers typically call its functions or methods directly within their code to leverage its capabilities. Libraries can significantly speed up the development process by providing pre-built solutions to common problems, allowing developers to focus on building the unique aspects of their applications.


### FvsL

A framework inverts control by dictating the overall structure and flow of the application, offering a comprehensive scope with high-level abstraction and predefined design patterns. Developers write code to fit into the framework's architecture. On the other hand, a library retains control with the developer, who decides when and where to use its specific functionalities. It focuses on particular tasks or functionalities without dictating the overall application structure. Developers integrate the library into their codebase as needed, allowing for greater flexibility in application design.


In this module, our main focus is on Express, a powerful backend framework that optimizes server-side application development. We will explore Express in-depth, uncovering its potential to create robust and efficient backend solutions.
