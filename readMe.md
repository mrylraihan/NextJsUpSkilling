A framework is a structured, pre-built platform or set of tools that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It offers a collection of libraries, functions, and reusable components that simplify and streamline the development process. Frameworks are designed to handle common tasks and functionalities, allowing developers to focus more on implementing specific features and logic unique to their applications. They abstract complex details, promote code reusability, enforce consistency, and speed up development by offering ready-made solutions for common tasks. # NextJsUpSkilling
